	abstract = {{Many image processing problems are ill-posed and must be regularized. Usually, a roughness penalty is imposed on the solution. The difficulty is to avoid the smoothing of edges, which are very important attributes of the image. The authors first give sufficient conditions for the design of such an edge-preserving regularization. Under these conditions, it is possible to introduce an auxiliary variable whose role is twofold. Firstly, it marks the discontinuities and ensures their preservation from smoothing. Secondly, it makes the criterion half-quadratic. The optimization is then easier. The authors propose a deterministic strategy, based on alternate minimizations on the image and the auxiliary variable. This yields two algorithms, ARTUR and LEGEND. The authors apply these algorithms to the problem of SPECT reconstruction.<>}},
