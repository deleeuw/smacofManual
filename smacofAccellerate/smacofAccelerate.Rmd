# Introduction

In this paper we study minimization of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) loss function
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X):=\frac12\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n} w_{ij}(\delta_{ij}-d_{ij}(X))^2
(\#eq:sdef)
\end{equation}
over all $n\times p$ *configuration* matrices $X$. Following @kruskal_64a, @kruskal_64b we call $\sigma(X)$ the *stress* of $X$. The symbol $:=$ is used for definitions.

In definition 
\@ref(eq:sdef) matrices $W=\{w_{ij}\}$ and $\Delta=\{\delta_{ij}\}$ are known non-negative, symmetric, and hollow. They contain, respectively, *weights* and *dissimilarities*. The matrix-valued function $D$, with $D(X)=\{d_{ij}(X)\}$, contains *Euclidean distances* between the rows of $X$. 

Throughout we assume, without loss of generality, that $W$ is irreducible, that $X$ is  column-centered, and that $\Delta$ is normalized by
\begin{equation}
\frac12\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n} w_{ij}\delta_{ij}^2=1.
(\#eq:delnorm)
\end{equation}

## Notation

It is convenient to have some matrix notation for the MDS problem.
We use the symmetric matrices $A_{ij}$, of order $n$, which have $+1$ for elements $(i,i)$ and $(j,j)$, $-1$ for elements $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$, and zeroes everywhere else. Using unit vectors $e_i$ and $e_j$ we can write
\begin{equation}
A_{ij}:=(e_i-e_j)(e_i-e_j)'.
(\#eq:adef)
\end{equation}

Following @deleeuw_C_77 we define
\begin{equation}
\rho(X):=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n} w_{ij}\delta_{ij}d_{ij}(X)=\text{tr}\ X'B(X)X,
(\#eq:rhodef)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
B(X):=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}\frac{\delta_{ij}}{r_{ij}(X)}A_{ij},
(\#eq:bdef)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
r_{ij}(X)=\begin{cases}
d_{ij}^{-1}(X)&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)>0,\\
0&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)=0.
\end{cases}
(\#eq:rdef)
\end{equation}

Also define
\begin{equation}
\eta^2(X):=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}d_{ij}^2(X)=\text{tr}\ X'VX,
(\#eq:etadef)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
V:=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}A_{ij}.
(\#eq:vdef)
\end{equation}
Thus
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)=1-\rho(X)+\frac12\eta^2(X)=1-\text{tr}\ X'B(X)X+\frac12\text{tr}\ X'VX.
(\#eq:sform)
\end{equation}
Both $B(X)$ and $V$ are positive semi-definite and doubly-centered. Because of the irreducibility of $W$ the matrix $V$ has rank $n-1$, with only the constant vectors in its null space.

Both $\rho$ and $\eta$ are homogeneous convex functions, with $\eta$ being a
norm on the space of column-centered configurations. The equations
$d_{ij}(X)=0$ for all $(i,j)$ for which 
$w_{ij}\delta_{ij}>0$ define a linear subspace of configuration space. If that
subspace only contains the zero matrix then $\rho$ is a norm as well. 

Note that $\rho$ is continuous, but it is not differentiable at $X$ if
$d_{ij}(X)=0$ for some $(i,j)$ for which $w_{ij}\delta_{ij}>0$. Because
\begin{equation}
|d_{ij}(X)-d_{ij}(Y)|^2\leq\text{tr}\ (X-Y)'A_{ij}(X-Y)\leq 2p\|X-Y\|^2
(\#eq:lipschitz)
\end{equation}
we see that $\rho$, although not differentiable, is globally Lipschitz.

## The Guttman Transform

The *Guttman transform* of a configuration $X$, so named by @deleeuw_heiser_C_80 to honor the contribution of @guttman_68, is defined as the set-valued map
\begin{equation}
\Phi(X)=V^+\partial\rho(X),
(\#eq:phidef)
\end{equation}
with $V^+$ the Moore-Penrose inverse of $V$ and $\partial\rho(X)$ the
subdifferential of $\rho$ at $X$, i.e. the set of all $Z$ such that
$\rho(Y)\geq\rho(X)+\text{tr}\ Z'(Y-X)$
for all $Y$. Because $\rho$ is homogeneous of degree one we have that $Z\in\partial\rho(X)$
if and only if $\text{tr}\ Z'X=\rho(X)$ and
$\rho(Y)\geq\text{tr}\ Z'Y$ for all $Y$. For each $X$ 
the subdifferential $\partial\rho(X)$, and consequently the Guttman transform, is compact and convex. The map $\partial\rho$
is also positively homogeneous of degree zero, i.e. $\partial\rho(\alpha X)=\partial\rho(X)$ for all $X$ and all $\alpha\geq 0$. And consequently so is the
Guttman transform.

We start with the subdifferential of the distance function between
rows $i$ and $j$ of an $n\times p$ matrix. Straightforward calculation
gives
\begin{equation}
\partial d_{ij}(X)=\begin{cases}
\left\{d_{ij}^{-1}(e_i-e_j)(x_i-x_j)'\right\}&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)>0,\\
\left\{Z\mid Z=(e_i-e_j)z'\text{ with }z'z\leq1\right\}&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)=0.
\end{cases}
(\#eq:dsubsef)
\end{equation}
Thus if $d_{ij}(X)>0$, i.e. if $d_{ij}$ is differentiable at $X$,
then $\partial d_{ij}(X)$ is a singleton, containing only the gradient
at $X$.

From subdifferential calculus (@rockafellar_70, theorem 23.8 and 23.9) the subdifferential of $\rho$ is the linear combination
\begin{equation}
\partial\rho(X)=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}\partial d_{ij}(X)
(\#eq:subdif)
\end{equation}
Summation here is in the Minkovski sense, i.e. $\partial\rho(X)$ is the compact convex set of all linear combinations $\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}z_{ij}$,
with $z_{ij}\in\partial d_{ij}(X)$.

It follows that
\begin{equation}
\partial\rho(X)=B(X)X+Z
(\#eq:rhosubdef)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
Z\in\mathop{\sum\sum}\{w_{ij}\delta_{ij}\partial d_{ij}(X)\mid d_{ij}(X)=0\}.
(\#eq:zsubdef)
\end{equation}
It also follows that
\begin{equation}
\partial\sigma(X)=VX-\partial\rho(X)
(\#eq:sigsubdef)
\end{equation}
Since $\sigma$ is not convex the subdifferential in \@ref(eq:sigsubdef) is
the Clarke subdifferential (@clarke_75). 

Now $X$ is a stationary point of $\sigma$ if $0\in\partial\sigma(X)$, i.e.
if and only if $X\in V^+\partial\rho(X)$. This means that stationary
points are fixed points of the Guttman transform.
A necessary condition for $\sigma$ to have a local minimum at $X$ is that $X$ is a stationary point. The condition is far from sufficient, however, since stationary points can also be saddle points or local maxima. @deleeuw_R_93c shows that stress
only has a single local maximum at the origin $X=0$, but generally there
are many saddle points.

This little excursion into convex analysis is rarely needed in practice. It is
shown by @deleeuw_A_84f that a necessary condition for a local minimum at $X$
is that $d_{ij}(X)>0$ for all $(i,j)$ for which $w_{ij}\delta_{ij}>0$. At those
points $\sigma$ is differentiable, and thus the subdifferential 
\@ref(eq:sigsubdef) is a singleton, containing only the gradient.
We have $\nabla\rho(X)=B(X)X$ and $\nabla\sigma(X)=VX-B(X)X$.
Stationary points satisfy $X=V^+B(X)X$.

If $w_{ij}\delta_{ij}=0$ for some $(i,j)$ then there can be local minima
where $\sigma$ is not differentiable. This typically happens in 
multidimensional unfolding (@mair_deleeuw_wurzer_C_15).

By the definition of the subdifferential $Z\in\partial\rho(X)$ implies $\rho(X)\geq\text{tr}\ Z'X$ and $\rho(Y)\geq\text{tr}\ Z'Y$ for all $Y$. If
$d{ij}(X)>0$ this follows directly from the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
\begin{equation}
d_{ij}(Y)\geq d_{ij}^{-1}(X)\text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}Y.
(\#eq:csineq)
\end{equation}
Multiplying both sides by $w_{ij}\delta_{ij}$ and summing gives
\begin{equation}
\rho(Y)\geq\text{tr}\ Y'B(X)X
(\#eq:rhoineq)
\end{equation}
for all $Y$, with equality if $Y=X$. Not "if and only if", but just "if". We
also have equality if $Y=\alpha X$ for some $\alpha\geq 0$.

Using the Guttman transform we can use \@ref(eq:rhioneq) as the basic smacof equality
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)=1+\eta^2(X-\Phi(X))-\eta^2(\Phi(X))
(\#eq:smacofequality)
\end{equation}
for all $X$ and the basic smacof inequality
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)\leq 1+\eta^2(X-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))
(\#eq:smacofinequality)
\end{equation}
for all $X$ and $Y$.

Taken together \@ref(eq:smacofequality) and \@ref(eq:smacofinequality) imply the *sandwich inequality*
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\Phi(Y))\leq 1-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))\leq 1+\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))=\sigma(Y).
(\#eq:sandwich)
\end{equation}
If $Y$ is not a fixed point of $\Phi$ then the second inequality in the
chain is strict and thus $\sigma(\Phi(Y))<\sigma(Y)$. As we mentioned, the
first inequality may not be strict.


It also follows
from \@ref(eq:sandwich) that $\eta^2(\Phi(Y))\leq 1$. Thus the Guttman
transform of any configuration is in a convex and compact set, in fact an ellipsoid,
containing the origin.


# One-point Iteration

## Basic Iteration

The basic smacof algorithm generates the iterative sequence
\begin{equation}
X^{(k+1)}=\Phi(X^{(k)}),
(\#eq:basic)
\end{equation}
where it is understood that we stop if $X^{(k)}$ is a fixed point. If
$X^{(k)}$ is not a fixed point it follows from \@ref(eq:sandwich) that $\sigma(X^{(k+1)})<\sigma(X^{(k)})$.

@deleeuw_A_88b derives some additional results. Using up-arrows and down-arrows
to indicate monotone convergence we have

* $\rho(X^{(k)})\uparrow\rho_\infty$,
* $\eta^2(X^{(k)})\uparrow\eta^2_\infty=\rho_\infty$,
* $\sigma(X^{(k)})\downarrow\sigma_\infty=1-\rho_\infty$,

and, last but not least, the sequence $\{X^{(k)}\}$ is *asymptotically regular*, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\eta^2(X^{(k+1)}-X^{(k)})\rightarrow 0.
(\#eq:etaconv)
\end{equation}
Since the subdifferential is a upper semi-continuous (closed) map, and all iterates
are in the compact set $\eta^2(X)\leq 1$, and $\Phi$ is strictly monotonic
(decreases stress at non-fixed points), it follows from theorem 3.1 of @meyer_76 that
all accumulation points are fixed points and have the same function value $\sigma_\infty$. Moreover, from theorem 26.1 of @ostrowski_73, either the sequence
converges or the accumulation points form a continuum. 

In order to prove actual convergence, additional conditions are needed.
@meyer_76 proves convergence if the number of fixed points with function value $\sigma_\infty$ is finite, or if the sequence has an accumulation point that is an isolated fixed point. Both these conditions are not met in our case, because
of rotational indeterminacy. If $X_\infty$ is a fixed point, then the
continuum of rotations of $X_\infty$ are all fixed points.

@deleeuw_A_88b argues that the results so far are sufficient from a 
practical point of view. If we define an $\epsilon$-fixed-point as
any $X$ with $\eta(X-\Phi(X))<\eta$ then smacof produces such an
$\epsilon$-fixed-point in a finite number of steps. 

In two very recent
papers @ram_sabach_24 and @robini_wang_zhu_24 use the powerful Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) 
framework (ref)
to prove actual global convergence of smacof to a fixed point. We shall
use a more classical approach, based on the differentiability of the Guttman 
transform.


## Majorization and DCA

The original derivation of the smacof algorithm (@deleeuw_C_77, @deleeuw_heiser_C_77)
used the theory of maximization a ratio of norms discussed by @robert_67. Later
derivations (@deleeuw_heiser_C_80, @deleeuw_A_88b) used the fact that \@ref(eq:smacofinequality) defines a majorization scheme for stress. Convergence
then follows from the general *majorization principle* (these days mostly known
as the *MM principle*). A recent overview of the MM approach is @lange_16.

It was also realized early on that the smacof algorithm was a special case of the 
the difference-of-convex functions algorithm (DCA), introduced by Pham Dinh Tao around 
1980. Pham Dinh also started his work in the context of ratio's of norms, using 
Robert's fundamental ideas. Around 1985 he generalized his approach to minimizing
DC functions of the form $h=f-g$, with both $f$ and $g$ convex. The basic idea
is to use the subgradient inequality $g(x)\geq g(y)+z'(x-y)$, with $z\in\partial g(x)$,
to construct the majorization $h(x):=f(x)-g(y)-z'(x-y)$. Now $h$ is obviously convex in $x$. The DC algorithm then chooses the successor of $y$ as the minimizer of this convex majorizer over $x$. In smacof the role of $f$ is played by $\eta^2$ and the role of $g$ by $\rho$. The convex subproblem in each step is quadratic, and has the closed form solution provided by the Guttman transform. DCA is applied to MDS in @lethi_tao_01, and extensive recent surveys of the DC/DCA approach are @lethi_tao_18 and @lethi_tao_24.

## Rate of Convergence

In order to study the asymptotic rate of convergence of smacof, we have to 
compute the Jacobian of the Guttman transform and its eigenvalues (@ortega_rheinboldt_70, chapter 10). Thus we assume we are in the neighborhood of a local minimum, where the Guttman transform is (infinitely many times) differentiable. The derivative is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H)=V^+\sum w_{ij}\frac{\delta_{ij}}{d_{ij}(X)}\left\{A_{ij}H-\frac{\text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}H}{ \text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}X}A_{ij}X\right\}.
(\#eq:jacobian)
\end{equation}

It follows that $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(X)=0$ for all $X$ and the Jacobian has at least one
zero eigenvalue. If we think of \@ref(eq:jacobian) as a map on the space
of all $n\times p$ matrices, then there are an additional $p$ zero eigenvalues
corresponding with translational invariance. If we define \@ref(eq:jacobian)
on the column-centered matrices, then these eigenvalues disappear.

If $S$ is anti-symmetric and
$H=XS$ then $\text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}H=0$ and thus $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(XS)=\Phi(X)S$.
If in addition $X$ is a fixed point  then  $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(XS)=XS$,
which means $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X$ has $\frac12p(p-1)$ eigenvalues equal to one.
These correspond to the rotational indeterminacy of the MDS problem and the
smacof iterations.

Since $\Phi(X)=V^+\mathcal{D}\rho(X)$ the Jacobian of the Guttman transform
has a simple relationship with the second derivatives of $\rho$. Since 
$\rho$ is convex, all eigenvalues of the Jacobian are real and
nonnegative.

We have the bilinear form 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X(G,H)=\sum w_{ij}\frac{\delta_{ij}}{d_{ij}(X)}\left\{\text{tr}\ G'A_{ij}H-\frac{\text{tr}\ G'A_{ij}X\text{tr}\ H'A_{ij}X}{d_{ij}^2(X)}\right\}=\text{tr}\ G'V\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H).
(\#eq:hessian)
\end{equation}
It follows that
$0\lesssim\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X\lesssim B(X)$
in the Loewner sense. Of course
$\mathcal{D}^2\sigma_X=V-\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X$
At a local minimum $\mathcal{D}^2\sigma_X\gtrsim 0$, and consequently
$\mathcal{D}\Phi_X\lesssim I$. Thus all eigenvalues of the Jacobian at a local minimum are between zero and one.

We compute and store the Jacobian as a partitioned matrix with $p$ rows and columns
of the $n\times n$ matrices $\mathcal{D}_t\Phi_s(X)$, with $\Phi_s(X)$ column
$s$ of $X$. 
$$
\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X(e_ke_s',e_le_t')=
\delta^{st}\{B(X)\}_{kl}-\{U_{st}(X)\}_{kl}
$$
$$
U_{st}(X)=\sum w_{ij}\delta_{ij}\frac{(x_{is}-x_{js})(x_{it}-x_{jt})}{d_{ij}^3(X)}A_{ij}
$$

We apply basic iterations to the two-dimensional MDS analysis of the color-circle example from @ekman_54, which has
$n=14$ points. We always start with the classical Torgerson-Gower
solution and we stop if
$\sigma(X^{(k)})-\sigma(X^{(k+1)})<1e-15$. The fit in this example is very good and convergence is rapid. The
results for the final iteration are
```{r compute1, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h1 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 1, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```
In this output "chng" is $\eta(X^{(k)}-X^{(k+1)})$, and "labd" is an estimate
of the asymptotic convergence ratio, the "chng" divided by the "chng" of the 
previous iteration. To fifteen decimals stress is `r prettyNum(h1$s, digits = 15, format = "f")`

We compute the Jacobian using the numDeriv package (@gilbert_varadhan_19). Its eigenvalues are
```{r eval1, echo = FALSE}
jacob1 <- numHess(h1$x, h1$delta, h1$wgth, opt = 1)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob1)$values))
```
Note that the second largest and first non-trivial
eigenvalue is equal to "labd" from the final iteration.

## Orthogonalized Iteration

As @deleeuw_A_88b mentions, we cannot apply the basic point-of-attraction theorem 10.1.3 and the linear convergence theorem 10.1.4 from @ortega_rheinboldt_70, because there are these $\frac12 p(p-1$ eigenvalues equal to one. 

One way around this problem (@deleeuw_E_19h) is to rotate each update to orthogonality,
i.e. to principal components. Thus the update formula becomes $\Xi(X)=\Pi(\Phi(X))$, 
$\Pi(X)=XL$, where $L$ are the right singular vectors of $X$.

We compute the Jacobian of $\Xi$. By the chain rule
$$
\mathcal{D}\Xi_X(H)=\mathcal{D}\Pi_{\Phi(X)}(\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H))
$$
If $X'XL=L\Lambda$ with $L'L=LL'=I$, assuming the eigenvalues in
$\Lambda$ are all different,
$$
\mathcal{D}\Pi_X(H)=HL+XLS\\
$$
where $S$ is the anti-symmetric matrix with elements
$$
s_{ij}=-\frac{l_i'(H'X+X'H)l_j}{\lambda_i-\lambda_j}
$$

Thus, from ... and ...
$$
\mathcal{D}\Xi_X(H)=\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H)L+\Phi(X)LS
$$
with $L$ and $S$ computed at $\Phi(X)$. 

At a fixed point of $\Xi$ we have $\Phi(X)=X$ and $\Pi(X)=X$ and consequently
$L=I$ and $X'X=\Lambda$. Thus ... becomes
$$
\mathcal{D}\Xi_X(H)=\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H)+XS
$$
where now
$$
s_{ij}=-\frac{(H'X+X'H)_{ij}}{\lambda_i-\lambda_j}
$$
If $H=XA$ with $A$ anti-symmetric then
$$
\mathcal{D}\Xi_X(XA)=XA+XS
$$
$$
s_{ij}=-\frac{(A'\Lambda+\Lambda A)_{ij}}{\lambda_i-\lambda_j}=-a_{ij}
$$
Thus $\mathcal{D}\Xi_X(XA)=0$.

### end intermezzo

Now clearly this modified algorithm generates the same sequence of 
function values as basic smacof. Moreover $\Phi^n(X)=\Pi(\Phi^n(X))$,
which means that we can find any term of the orthogonal sequence
by orthogonalizing the corresponding term in the basic sequence.
Thus, in actual computation, there is no need to orthogonalize, we
may as well compute the basic sequence and orthogonalize after
convergence.

Theoretically, however, orthogonalization gives the same 
convergence rate as the basic sequence, but the Jacobian
of $\Phi_o$ at a local minimum does not have the unit
eigenvalues any more. They are replaced by zeroes, reflecting
the fact that we are iterating on the nonlinear manifold
or orthogonal column-centered matrices. It is now sufficient
for linear convergence to assume that the largest
eigenvalue of the Jacobian at the solution is strictly
less than one, or alternatively assume that one of the accumulation
points is an isolated local minimum.




```{r compute3, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h3 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 3, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```

```{r eval3, echo = FALSE}
jacob3 <- numHess(h3$x, h3$delta, h3$wgth, opt = 3)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob3)$values))
```

$$
\Phi^o(X)=\Phi(X)K(\Phi(X))
$$

## Subspace Restrictions

Instead of orthogonalizing we can also restrict $X$ to be in the subspace
of all lower triangular column-centered $n\times p$ matrices (which means $x_{ij}=0$
for all $i<j$). There are two different ways to accomplish this.

Method one uses a rotation of $X$ to lower triangular form. The theory
is pretty much the same as for the rotation to principal components
in the previous section.

```{r compute2, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h2 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 2, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```
The results are the same as for the basis sequence, as predicted. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian are
```{r eval2, echo = FALSE}
jacob2 <- numHess(h2$x, h2$delta, h2$wgth, opt = 2)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob2)$values))
```
The unit eigenvalues from the unrotated solution have been replaced by zeroes.

Method two uses the theory of constrained smacof from @deleeuw_heiser_C_80. This
means computing the Guttman update and then projecting it on the subspace of
lower triangular matrices. We create $p$ column-centered matrices $Y_s$, of dimension $n\times(n-s)$, that satisfy $Y_s'VY_s=I$ and have their first $s-1$ rows equal to zero. Now column $s$ of $X$ is restricted to be of the form $x_s=Y_s\theta_s$. 
$$
x_s^{(k+1)}=Y_sY_s'V\{\Phi(X^{(k)})\}_s
$$


# Two Point Iteration

## Basic

@deleeuw_heiser_C_80 suggested the "relaxed" update
\begin{equation}
\Psi(X):=2\Phi(X)-X
\end{equation}
The reasoning here is two-fold. First, the smacof inequality \@ref(eq:smacofinequality) says
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)\leq 1+\eta^2(X-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))
\end{equation}
If $X=\alpha\Phi(Y)+(1-\alpha)Y$ then this becomes
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\alpha\Phi(Y)+(1-\alpha)Y)\leq 1+(1-\alpha)^2\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))
\end{equation}
If $(1-\alpha)^2\leq 1$ then 
\begin{equation}
1+(1-\alpha)^2\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))\leq 1+\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))=\sigma(Y)
\end{equation}
Thus updating with $X^{(k+1)}=\alpha\Phi(X^{(k)})+(1-\alpha)X^{(k)}$ is a stricly
monotone algorithm as long as $0\leq\alpha\leq 2$.

The second reason for choosing the relaxed update given by @deleeuw_heiser_C_80
is that its asymptotic convergence rate is 
\begin{equation}
\max_s|2\lambda_s-1|=\max(2\lambda_{\text{max}}-1,1-2\lambda_{\text{min}}).
\end{equation}
@deleeuw_heiser_C_80 then somewhat carelessly assume that this is equal to
$2\lambda_{\text{max}}-1$ and argue that if $\lambda_{\text{max}}=1-\epsilon$
with $\epsilon$ small then 
\begin{equation}
2\lambda_{\text{max}}-1=1-2\epsilon\approx(1-\epsilon)^2=\lambda_{\text{max}}^2,
\end{equation}
so that the relaxed update requires approximately half the number of iterations of the
basic update. Despite the somewhat sloppy reasoning, the approximate halving of the number of iterations is often observed in practice. 

It turns out (@deleeuw_R_06b), however, that applying the relaxed update
has some unintended consequences, which basically imply that it should never
be used without some additional computation. Let's take a look at the
Ekman results.
```{r compute4, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h4 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 4, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)

The loss function value decreases. The number of iterations is reduced from 57 to 23.
But we see that $\eta^2(X^{(k+1)}-X^{(k)})$ does not converge to zero, and that $\sigma_k$ converges to a value which does not even correspond to a local minimum of $\sigma$.

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian are 
```{r eval4, echo = FALSE}
jacob4 <- numHess(h4$x, h4$delta, h4$wgth, opt = 4)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob4)$values))
```

If we check the conditions of theorem 3.1 in @meyer_76 we see that, although the 
algorithmic map is closed and the iterates are in a compact set, $\Psi$
is not strictly monotone at some non-fixed points. Suppose $X$ is a fixed point and  $\tau\not= 1$. Then
$\tau\overline{X}$ is not a fixed point, because 
$\Psi(\tau\overline{X})=(2-\tau)\overline{X}$. And
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\tau\overline{X})=1-\tau\rho(\overline{X})+\frac12\tau^2\eta^2(\overline{X})=
1-\frac12\tau(2-\tau)\rho(\overline{X})=\sigma((2-\tau)\overline{X})
\end{equation}
Thus the algorithm has convergent subsequences which may not converge to a fixed
point of $\Psi$ (and thus of $\Phi$). And indeed, an analysis of the results show that the method produces a sequence $X^{(k)}$ with two subseqences. If $\overline{X}$ is a fixed point of $\Phi$ then there is a $\tau>0$ such that
the subsequence with $k$ even converges to $\tau\overline{X}$
while the subsequence with $k$ odd converges to $(2-\tau)\overline{X}$.

This suggests a simple fix. After convergence of the funcion values we make
a final update using $\Phi$ instead of $\Psi$. Computationally this is simple to do. If the final iteration updates $X^{(k)}$ to $X^{(k+1)}=\Psi(X^{(k)})$ then
set the final solution to $\frac12(X^{(k)}+X^{(k+1)})$. Making thus final
adjustment in the Ekman sequence gives us a final stress equal to `r prettyNum(h4$s, digits = 15, format = "f")`.

## Doubling

The analysis in the previous section suggest the update function $\Psi^2$, i.e.
$$
X^{(k+1)}=\Psi(\Psi(X^{(k)})).
$$
The asymptotic convergence rate is 
$$
\max_s (2\lambda_s-1)^2=\max\{ (2\lambda_\text{max}-1)^2, (2\lambda_\text{min}-1)^2\}
$$.

With $\Psi^2$ the algorithm is everywhere strictly monotonic and
converges to a fixed point. But not all problems have disappeared.
If $X$ is a stationary point of $\sigma$, and thus a fixed 
point of $\Phi$, $\Psi$, and $\Psi^2$, then $\tau X$ is a 
fixed point of $\Psi^2$ for all $\tau>0$. Thus we cannot
exclude the possibility that the sequence converges to
a fixed point proportional to $X$, but not equal to $X$.

Here are the results for the Ekman data if we use $\Psi^2$.
```{r compute5, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h5 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 5, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```

```{r eval5, echo = FALSE}
jacob5 <- numHess(h5$x, h5$delta, h5$wgth, opt = 4)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob5)$values))
```

stress is `r prettyNum(h5$s, digits = 15, format = "f")`

## Scaling

@deleeuw_R_06b discusses some other ways to fix of the relaxed update problem.  

## Switching

\begin{equation}
\Phi(\Psi(X))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\max_s|\lambda_s(2\lambda_s-1)|
\end{equation}
