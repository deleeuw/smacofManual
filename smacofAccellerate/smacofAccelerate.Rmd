# Introduction

In this paper we study minimization of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) loss function
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X):=\frac12\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n} w_{ij}(\delta_{ij}-d_{ij}(X))^2
(\#eq:sdef)
\end{equation}
over all $n\times p$ *configuration* matrices $X$. Here $W=\{w_{ij}\}$ and $\Delta=\{\delta_{ij}\}$ are known non-negative, symmetric, and hollow matrices of *weights* and *dissimilarities* and $D(X)=\{d_{ij}(X)\}$ is the matrix of *Euclidean distances* between the rows of $X$. The symbol $:=$ is used for definitions.

Throughout we assume, without loss of generality, that $W$ is irreducible, that $X$ is  column-centered, and that $\Delta$ is normalized by
\begin{equation}
\frac12\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n} w_{ij}\delta_{ij}^2=1.
(\#eq:delnorm)
\end{equation}

## Notation

It is convenient to have some matrix notation for our MDS problem.
We use the symmetric matrices $A_{ij}$, of order $n$, which have $+1$ at $(i,i)$ and $(j,j)$, $-1$ at $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$, and zeroes everywhere else. Using unit vectors $e_i$ and $e_j$ we can write
\begin{equation}
A_{ij}:=(e_i-e_j)(e_i-e_j)'
(\#eq:adef)
\end{equation}

Following @deleeuw_C_77 and @deleeuw_A_88b we define
\begin{equation}
\rho(X):=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n} w_{ij}\delta_{ij}d_{ij}(X)=\text{tr}\ X'B(X)X,
(\#eq:rhodef)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
B(X):=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}\frac{\delta_{ij}}{r_{ij}(X)}A_{ij},
(\#eq:bdef)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
r_{ij}(X)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{d_{ij}(X)}&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)>0,\\
0&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)=0.
\end{cases}
(\#eq:rdef)
\end{equation}

Also define
\begin{equation}
\eta^2(X):=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}d_{ij}^2(X)=\text{tr}\ X'VX,
(\#eq:etadef)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
V:=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}A_{ij}.
(\#eq:vdef)
\end{equation}
Thus
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)=1-\rho(X)+\frac12\eta^2(X)=1-\text{tr}\ X'B(X)X+\frac12\text{tr}\ X'VX.
(\#eq:sform)
\end{equation}
Both $B(X)$ and $V$ are positive semi-definite and doubly-centered. Because of the irreducibility of $W$ the matrix $V$ has rank $n-1$, with only the constant vectors in its null space.

Both $\rho$ and $\eta$ are homogeneous convex functions, with $\eta$ being a
norm on the space of column-centered configurations. If the equations
$d_{ij}(X)=0$, i.e. $x_i=x_j$, for all $(i,j)$ for which 
$w_{ij}\delta_{ij}>0$ only have the trivial solution $X=0$ then 
$\rho$ is a norm as well. Note that $\rho$ is not differentiable if
$d_{ij}(X)=0$ for an $(i,j)$ for which  $w_{ij}\delta_{ij}>0$.  
Because
\begin{equation}
|d_{ij}(X)-d_{ij}(Y)|^2\leq\text{tr}\ (X-Y)'A_{ij}(X-Y)\leq 2p\|X-Y\|^2
(\#eq:lipschitz)
\end{equation}
we see that $\rho$, although not differentiable, is globally Lipschitz.

## The Guttman Transform

The *Guttman transform* of a configuration $X$, so named by @deleeuw_heiser_C_80 to honor the contribution of @guttman_68, is defined as the set-valued map
\begin{equation}
\Phi(X)=V^+\partial\rho(X),
(\#eq:phidef)
\end{equation}
with $V^+$ the Moore-Penrose inverse of $V$ and $\partial\rho(X)$ the
subdifferential of $\rho$ at $X$, i.e. the set of all $Z$ such that
$\rho(Y)\geq\rho(X)+\text{tr}\ Z'(Y-X)$
for all $Y$. Because of homogeneity we have that $Z\in\partial\rho(X)$
if and only if $\text{tr}\ Z'X=\rho(X)$ and
$\rho(Y)\geq\text{tr}\ Z'Y$ for all $Y$. Because $\rho$ is continuous,
its subdifferential is compact and convex.

From Moreau-Rockafellar theorem (@rockafellar_70) the subdifferential of
$\rho$ is the Minkovski linear combination
\begin{equation}
\partial\rho(X)=\mathop{\sum\sum}_{1\leq i<j\leq n}w_{ij}\delta_{ij}\partial d_{ij}(X)
(\#eq:subdif)
\end{equation}

For completeness we give an explicit formula for the subdifferential of the distance function between rows $i$ and $j$ of an $n\times p$ matrix.
\begin{equation}
\partial d_{ij}(X)=\begin{cases}
\left\{\frac{1}{d_{ij}}(e_i-e_j)(x_i-x_j)'\right\}&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)>0,\\
\left\{Z\mid Z=(e_i-e_j)z'\text{ with }z'z\leq1\right\}&\text{ if }d_{ij}(X)=0.
\end{cases}
(\#eq:dsubsef)
\end{equation}
Thus of $d_{ij}(X)>0$, i.e. if $d_{ij}$ is differentiable at $X$,
then $\partial d_{ij}(X)$ is a singleton, containing only the gradient
at $X$.

It follows that
\begin{equation}
\partial\rho(X)=B(X)X+Z
(\#eq:rhosubdef)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
Z\in\mathop{\sum\sum}\{w_{ij}\delta_{ij}\partial d_{ij}(X)\mid d_{ij}(X)=0\}.
(\#eq:zsubdef)
\end{equation}

stationary point

This little excursion into convex analysis is rarely needed in practice. It is
shown by @deleeuw_A_84f that a necessary condition for a local minimum at $X$
is that $d_{ij}(X)>0$ for all $(i,j)$ for which $w_{ij}\delta_{ij}>0$. At those
points $\sigma$ is differentiable, and thus the subdifferential is a singleton,
containing only the gradient.

Cauchy Schwartz

If $Z\in\partial\rho(X)$ then $\rho(Y)\geq\text{tr}\ Z'Y$.


Using the Guttman transform we can derive the equality
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)=1+\eta^2(X-\Phi(X))-\eta^2(\Phi(X))
(\#eq:smacofequality)
\end{equation}
for all $X$ and the inequality
\begin{equation}
\sigma(X)\leq 1+\eta^2(X-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))
(\#eq:smacofinequality)
\end{equation}
for all $X$ and $Y$.

Taken together \@ref(eq:smacofequality) and \@ref(eq:smacofinequality) imply the *sandwich inequality*
\begin{equation}
\sigma(\Phi(Y))\leq 1-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))\leq 1+\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))=\sigma(Y).
(\#eq:sandwich)
\end{equation}
If $Y$ is not a fixed point of $\Phi$ then the second inequality in the
chain is strict and thus $\sigma(\Phi(Y))<\sigma(Y)$. It also follows
from \@ref(eq:sandwich) that $\eta^2(\Phi(Y))\leq 1$.


# One-point Methods

## Basic Iteration

The basic smacof algorithm generates the iterative sequence
$$
X^{(k+1)}=\Phi(X^{(k)}),
$$
where it is understood that we stop if $X^{(k)}$ is a fixed point. If
$X^{(k)}$ is not a fixed point it follows from \@ref(eq:sandwich) that $\sigma(X^{(k+1)})<\sigma(X^{(k)})$.

@deleeuw_A_88b derives some additional results. Using up-arrows and down-arrows
to indicate monotone convergence we have

* $\rho(X^{(k)})\uparrow\rho_\infty$,
* $\eta^2(X^{(k)})\uparrow\eta^2_\infty=\rho_\infty$,
* $\sigma(X^{(k)})\downarrow\sigma_\infty=1-\rho_\infty$,

and, last but not least, the sequence $\{X^{(k)}\}$ is *asymptotically regular*, i.e.

$$
\eta^2(X^{(k+1)}-X^{(k)})\rightarrow 0
$$
Since the subdifferential is a upper semi-continuous (closed) map, and all iterates
are in the compact set $\eta^2(X)\leq 1$, and $\Phi$ is strictly monotonic
(decreases stress at non-fixed points), it follows from @meyer_76 that
all accumulation points are fixed points and have the same function value $\sigma_\infty$. Moreover, from @ostrowski_66, either the sequence
converges or the accumulation points form a continuum. 

In order to prove actual convergence, additional conditions are needed.
@meyer_76 proves convergence if the number of fixed points with function value $\sigma_\infty$ is finite, or if the sequence has an accumulation point that is an isolated fixed point. Both these conditions are not met in our case, because
of rotational indeterminacy. If $X_\infty$ is a fixed point, then the
continuum of rotations of $X_\infty$ are all fixed points.

@deleeuw_A_88b argues that the results so far are sufficient from a 
practical point of view. If we define an $\epsilon$-fixed-point as
any $X$ with $\eta(X-\Phi(X))<\eta$ then smacof produces such an
$\epsilon$-fixed-point in a finite number of steps. 

In two very recent
papers @ram_sabach_24 and @robini_wang_zhu_24 use the powerful Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) 
machinery (ref)
to prove actual convergence of smacof to a fixed point. We shall
use the more classical approach based on the differentiability of the Guttman 
transform.


## Majorization and Difference-of-Convex Function Algorithms

The original derivation of the smacof algorithm (@deleeuw_C_77, @deleeuw_heiser_C_77)
used the framework of maximizing the ratio of norms discussed by @robert_67. Later
derivations (@deleeuw_heiser_C_80, @deleeuw_A_88b) used the fact that \@ref(eq:smacofinequality) defines a majorization scheme for stress. Convergence
then follows from the general *majorization principle* (these days mostly known
as the *MM principle*). A recent overview of the MM approach is @lange_16.

It was also realized early on that the smacof algorithm was a special case of the 
the difference-of-convex functions algorithm (DCA), introduced by Pham Dinh Tao around 
1980. Pham Dinh also started his work in the context of ratio's of norms, using 
Robert's fundamental ideas. Around 1985 he generalized his approach to minimizing
DC functions of the form $h=f-g$, with both $f$ and $g$ convex. The basic idea
is to use the subgradient inequality $g(x)\geq g(y)+z'(x-y)$, with $z\in\partial g(x)$,
to construct the majorization $h(x):=f(x)-g(y)-z'(x-y)$. Now $h$ is obviously convex in $x$. The DC algorithm then chooses the successor of $y$ as the minimizer of this convex majorizer over $x$. In smacof the role of $f$ is played by $\eta^2$ and the role of $g$ by $\rho$. The convex subproblem in each step is quadratic, and has the closed form solution provided by the Guttman transform. DCA is applied to MDS in @lethi_tao_01, and extensive recent surveys of the DC/DCA approach are @lethi_tao_18 and @lethi_tao_24.

## Rate of Convergence

In order to study the asymptotic rate of convergence of smacof, we have to 
study the Jacobian of the Guttman transform and its eigenvalues (@ortega_rheinboldt_70, chapter 10). Thus we assume we are in the neighborhood of a local minimum,
where the Guttman transform is (infinitely many times) differentiable. The
derivative is

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H)=V^+\sum w_{ij}\frac{\delta_{ij}}{d_{ij}(X)}\left\{A_{ij}H-\frac{\text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}H}{ \text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}X}A_{ij}X\right\}.
(\#eq:jacobian)
\end{equation}

Thus $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(X)=0$ for all $X$ and the Jacobian has at least one
zero eigenvalue. If we think of \@ref(eq:jacobian) as a map on the space
of all $n\times p$ matrices, then there are an additional $p$ zero eigenvalues
corresponding with translational invariance. If we define \@ref(eq:jacobian)
on the column-centered matrices, then these eigenvalues disappear.

If $S$ is anti-symmetric and
$H=XS$ then $\text{tr}\ X'A_{ij}H=0$ and thus $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(XS)=\Phi(X)S$.
If in addition $X$ is a fixed point  then  $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(XS)=V^+B(X)XS=XS$,
which means $\mathcal{D}\Phi_X$ has $\frac12p(p-1)$ eigenvalues equal to one.
They quantify the rotational indeterminacy of the MDS problem and the
smacof iterations.

Since $\Phi(X)=V^+\mathcal{D}\rho(X)$ the Jacobian of the Guttman transform
has a simple relationship with the second derivatives of $\rho$, which are 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X(H,H)=\sum w_{ij}\frac{\delta_{ij}}{d_{ij}(X)}\left\{\text{tr}\ H'A_{ij}H-\frac{\{\text{tr}\ H'A_{ij}X\}^2}{d_{ij}^2(X)}\right\}=\text{tr}\ H'V\mathcal{D}\Phi_X(H).
(\#eq:hessian)
\end{equation}
It follows that
$0\lesssim\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X\lesssim B(X)$
in the Loewner sense. Of course
$\mathcal{D}^2\sigma_X=V-\mathcal{D}^2\rho_X$
At a local minimum $\mathcal{D}^2\sigma_X\gtrsim 0$, and consequently
$\mathcal{D}\Phi_X\lesssim I$. Thus all eigenvalues of the Jacobian are  
between zero and one.


We apply basic iterations to the color-circle example from @ekman_54, which has
$n=14$ points. The fit is very good and convergence is rapid. We stop when
$\sigma(X^{(k)})-\sigma(X^{(k+1)})<1e-15$. The
results for the final iteration are
```{r compute1, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h1 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 1, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```
In this output chng is $\eta(X^{(k)}-X^{(k+1)}$, and labd is an estimate
of the asymptotic convergence ratio, the chng divided by the chng of the 
previous iteration. We always start with the classical Torgerson-Gower
solution. To fifteen decimals stress is `r prettyNum(h1$s, digits = 15, format = "f")`

We compute the Jacobian using the numDeriv package (@gilbert_varadhan_19). Its eigenvalues are
```{r eval1, echo = FALSE}
jacob1 <- numHess(h1$x, h1$delta, h1$wgth, opt = 1)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob1)$values))
```
Note that the second largest and forst non-trivial
eigenvalue is equal to labd from the final iteration.

## Rotated Basic Iteration

As @deleeuw_A_88b mentions, we cannot apply the basic Ostrowski point-of-attraction theorem 10.1.3 and the linear convergence theorem 10.1.4 from @ortega_rheinboldt_70, because there are these $\frac12 p(p-1$ eigenvalues equal to one. 

One way around this problem is to rotate each update to orthogonality. Thus the
update formula is $\Phi_o(X)=\Pi(\Phi(X))$ by
applying the QR decomposition or the singular value decomposition to 
$\Phi(X)$. Somes simple R code which can be used for this purpose is
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- x %*% qr.Q(qr(t(x[1:ndim, ])))
x <- x %*% svd(x)$v
```
Now clearly this modified algorithm generates the same sequence of 
function values as basic smacof. Moreover $\Theta^n_o(X)=\Pi(\Phi^n(X))$,
which means that we can find any term of the orthogonal sequence
by orthogonalizing the corresponding term in the basic sequence.
Thus, in actual computation, there is no need to orthogonalize, we
may as well run the basic seuence and orthogonalize after
convergence.

Theoretically, however, orthogonalization gives the same 
convergence rate as the basic sequence, but the Jacobian
of $\Phi_o$ at a local minimum does not have the unit
eigenvalues any more. They are replaced by zeroes, reflecting
the fact that we are iterating on the nonlinear manifold
or orthogonal column-centered matrices. It is now sufficient
for linear convergence to assume that the largest
eigenvalue of the Jacobian at the solution is strictly
less than one, or alternatively assume that one of the accumulation
points is an isolated local minimum.

We guvce the results by applying the two orthogonalization methods
to the Ekman sequence. 

```{r compute2, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h2 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 2, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```

```{r eval2, echo = FALSE}
jacob2 <- numHess(h2$x, h2$delta, h2$wgth, opt = 2)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob2)$values))
```

```{r compute3, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h3 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 3, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```

```{r eval3, echo = FALSE}
jacob3 <- numHess(h3$x, h3$delta, h3$wgth, opt = 3)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob3)$values))
```

# Two Point Iteration

## Basic

@deleeuw_heiser_C_80 suggested the "relaxed" update
$$
\Psi(X)=2\Phi(X)-X
$$
The reasoning here is two-fold. The smacof inequality \@ref(eq:smacofinequality) says
$$
\sigma(X)\leq 1+\eta^2(X-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))
$$
If $X=\alpha\Phi(Y)+(1-\alpha)Y$ then this becomes
$$
\sigma(\alpha\Phi(Y)+(1-\alpha)Y)\leq 1+(1-\alpha)^2\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))
$$
If $(1-\alpha)^2\leq 1$ then 
$$
1+(1-\alpha)^2\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))\leq 1+\eta^2(Y-\Phi(Y))-\eta^2(\Phi(Y))=\sigma(Y)
$$
Thus updating with $X^{(k+1)}=\alpha\Phi(X^{(k)})+(1-\alpha)X^{(k)}$ is a stricly
monotone algorithm as long as $0\leq\alpha\leq 2$.

rate

It turns out that applying the relaxed update
has some unintended consequences, which basically imply that it should never
be used without some additional computation. Let's take a look at the
Ekman results.
```{r compute4, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h4 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 4, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```


We see that $\eta^2(X^{(k+1)}-X^{(k)})$ does not converge to zero, and that
$\sigma_k$ converges to a value which does not even correspond to a local minimum
of $\sigma$.

```{r eval4, echo = FALSE}
jacob4 <- numHess(h4$x, h4$delta, h4$wgth, opt = 4)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob4)$values))
```

A more thorough analysis of the results show that the method produces a sequence
$X^{(k)}$ with two subseqences. If $\overline{X}$ is a fixed point of
$\Phi$ then there is a $\tau>0$ such that
the subsequence with $k$ even converges to $\tau\overline{X}$
while the subsequence with $k$ odd converges to $(2-\tau)\overline{X}$.

what goes wrong ? not strictly monotone at $\tau\overline{X}$

stress is `r prettyNum(h4$s, digits = 15, format = "f")`


```{r compute5, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
h5 <- smacofAccelerate(ekman, opt = 5, halt = 0, epsf = 1e-15, verbose = 1)
```
stress is `r prettyNum(h5$s, digits = 15, format = "f")`

```{r eval5, echo = FALSE}
jacob5 <- numHess(h5$x, h5$delta, h5$wgth, opt = 4)
mPrint(Re(eigen(jacob5)$values))
```
